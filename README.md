# AcelerometerGpsKaliope
This is the software in c++ for the accelerometer for the gps kaliope moved from my repository bitBucket

## C++ Accelerometer sensor and flow sensor.
This is another software and hardware related to the GPS. I added and made out this feature because the drivers had a careless way of driving, so the vehicles were being regularly struck by rocks or other obstacles resulting in staggering maintenance bills for the company. Now each car has an Accelerometer sensor attached to its metal body, which is read by a microcontroller each 9ms or roughly 100 times per second, when the G-forces go out from certain levels the software converts the analog lecture into a digital value and categorizes the lecture according to a given scale. The microcontroller sends this information by I2C to the main processor on the GPS and saved it on the SD card then is sent to the server almost in real-time, the web page alert and show on the map which and where the car was struck and within 3 different colors the G-force received for the unit in each axis X Y and Z.
The flow meter sensor measures the quantity of GLP gas that is charged in the GLP Fuel station and delivers that data to the server including the time, liters, and location preventing dodgy employees. Now, with both features, the company has the opportunity to reduce its necessary maintenance budget and maximize its profits.
 I'm working on the new version. I have just sent the Gerber files to China. This version is now almost 80% SMD components, I'm amending the code now on Visual Studio because I'm looking forward to a Patent.


### Please i would really appreciate if you whatch all my video, just put it in 2x speed if it seems too long
